= Magnolia Café Backend

The Café Finder's backend is a stock Magnolia 6 project configured with a light module.
The `cafe-backend` light module defines 3 things:

* The `cafe` Content Type, defining the raw model and datasource coordinates
* A `cafes` Content app for creating/editing café entries
* A REST Delivery endpoint configuring Magnolia to serve cafés at the following
conventional base-URL: /.rest/delivery/cafes/v1, and resolving/inlining the photos
referenced in the Magnolia DAM.

Mind that despite Content Types creating a JCR workspace for us, there is no workspace
permission granted to the _anonymous_ role by default. Go to Security app, edit the
anonymous role, and add Read permission to the cafes workspace.
